# Maze Trick

### Design Brief
A basic maze game.

In this game, the player can control the move of the charactor - the Sunglasses Orange by clicking the 4 direction buttons. The goal is to reach to the destination point.

### Rules - How to play
* Control the Orange by clicking on the 4 direction buttons displayed on the screen, the orange will move one step according to the direction the player click on.

* Reach the destination with 26 steps. There's a counter displayed beside showing the number of steps you still have.

* There are functional tools in the maze map. Try to collide them and find out what they do.

* Try not to engage the demon.

* Hit "Esc" on the keyboard to restart the game.


### Application

The game was created for recreation. This is only the first level of the game, in the future higher and harder levels will be created. One example how to expand this project is to display it in public places, for instance, on the big screen in a metrorail station, and it offers people an alternative to kill time while they're waiting for the train.

Another example is to create a series of similar maze games for young children as entertainment.
